Jan 1, 2022</span></div><div class=post-entry><p><h2 id=a-song-of-charge-books-and-actuaries>A Song of Charge Books and Actuaries</h2><p>Insurance is a simple question with a complicated answer:</p><p><em>How can an insurance company pay the minimal amount while still retaining employers as customers?</em></p><p>Hospitals (and the providers of which they&rsquo;re composed) have a similar question:</p><p><em>How can I charge the most that enough insurance companies and patients will pay to be profitable?</em></p><p>This battle happens on the other side of the curtain and patients know virtually nothing until they receive their bill submitted through insurance automatically. This provider-insurance battle is well reported on and results in the wild differences in costs of procedures. A safe guess is just &ldquo;thousands of dollars&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve experienced this and so has anyone else with the misfortune of requiring medical services. No procedures done and a CT resulted in a $5000 bill right when I was switching employers.</p></p><a href=https://nickdnickd.com/posts/2022-11-20-heath-insurance-transparency/ class=post-read-more>Read More</a></div></article><article class=post-preview><a href=https://nickdnickd.com/posts/2021-3-1-crypto-taxes/><h2 class=post-title>IRS v BTC</h2></a><div class=postmeta><span class=meta-post><i class="fa fa-calendar-alt"></i>

Sep 12, 2020</span></div><div class=post-entry><p><h2 id=interview-season>Interview Season</h2><p>Doctors have it rough. After graduating medical school, they enter a period of indentured servitude known as <em>residency</em>. It is not uncommon to hear of over 80 hour weeks, 12 hour shifts and DOMA&rsquo;s. DOMA stands for &ldquo;Day Off, My Ass&rdquo; which describes the period of time between a night shift, letting out at 7am, and a day shift starting at 7am. Technically 24 hours, but most of it is spent asleep. In between these brutal shifts, a resident very near and dear to my heart has begun interviewing for a fellowship. A fellowship is a brief extension to residency that allows a doctor to focus on a specific area within their field of medicine. One example is ultrasound. This is a rapidly developing subspecialty of emergency medicine because it provides a quick, noninvasive view of a patient&rsquo;s internal state.</p></p><a href=https://nickdnickd.com/posts/2020-09-12-avoiding-manual-data/ class=post-read-more>Read More</a></div></article><article class=post-preview><a href=https://nickdnickd.com/posts/2018-01-16-let-there-be-sound/><h2 class=post-title>Let There Be Sound</h2></a><div class=postmeta><span class=meta-post><i class="fa fa-calendar-alt"></i>
Jan 16, 2018</span></div><div class=post-entry><p><h2 id=beautiful-soup>Beautiful Soup</h2><p>Does it bother anyone else to think about how we can&rsquo;t completely describe complicated things? Most of us have heard of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle>Uncertainty principle</a> describing that a more accurate measurement of position of a particle sacrifies the momentum accuracy. Here breadth, by principle, is sacrificed for depth. On a larger scale, we probably do not have enough compute on planet earth to describe a cold front, let alone weather, in a way that yeilds complete confidence in weather reports. Instead, we&rsquo;d like to know generally if it will rain. This is us sacrificing depth, by lack of resources, for beadth.</p></p><a href=https://nickdnickd.com/posts/2018-01-16-let-there-be-sound/ class=post-read-more>Read More</a></div></article></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><p class="credits copyright"><p class="credits theme-by"><a href=https://nickdnickd.com/>Nick D Blog</a>,
