After graduating medical school, they enter a period of indentured servitude known as <em>residency</em>. It is not uncommon to hear of over 80 hour weeks, 12 hour shifts and DOMA’s. DOMA stands for “Day Off, My Ass” which describes the period of time between a night shift letting out at 7am and a day shift the next morning. Technically 24 hours, but most of it is spent asleep. Between all of this a resident very near and dear to my heart has begun interviewing for a fellowship. A fellowship is a brief extension to residency that allows a doctor to focus on a specific area within their type of medicine. One example is ultrasound. This is a rapidly developing subspecialty of emergency medicine because it provides a rapid, noninvasive view of a patient’s internal state. Throughout the country there are over 100 ultrasound fellowship programs, all vying for candidates on <a href=\"https://eusfellowships.com/\">this website</a>.

One can tell that the data are organized on the backend in some sort of structure, however when presented to the user, it is tough to compare programs side-by-side. hello babe</p>\n<h2>TODO add the query variable</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Avoiding Manual Data Entry","date":"September 12, 2020","description":"at all costs"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/web-scraping/2018-01-16-Let-There-Be-Sound/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/fft-basics/2018-01-16-Let-There-Be-Sound/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Let There Be Sound"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","2841359383"]}
